   - All franchises must adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOP) as outlined in the franchise manual. This includes but is not limited to daily operations, customer service protocols, financial management, and inventory controls.

   - Franchises are required to submit weekly sales reports by the end of the business day on Monday. These reports must include detailed breakdowns of daily sales, inventory levels, and employee performance metrics.
   - Monthly financial summaries, including profit and loss statements, must be submitted by the 5th of each month.
   - Any discrepancies or irregularities in financial reports must be reported immediately to the Franchise Business Consultant (FBC).

**3. Compliance and Audits:**
   - Franchises will undergo routine audits twice a year to ensure compliance with corporate standards. Audits will review financial records, customer feedback, and adherence to SOPs.
